Add new exception handling patterns

This commit adds comprehensive examples of proper OpenStack
exception handling patterns, including specific exceptions,
logging practices, and error propagation techniques.

The initial examples were generated using Claude Code based on
existing OpenStack nova and neutron patterns. Manual modifications
included adding project-specific context, improving documentation,
and ensuring compliance with current hacking rules.

## üìù Contribution Process

### 1. Fork and Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/openstack-ai-style-guide.git
cd openstack-ai-style-guide
```

### 2. Create Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-pattern-examples
```

### 3. Make Changes
Follow the repository structure:
- Style rules: Update `docs/quick-rules.md` and `docs/comprehensive-guide.md`
- Examples: Add to `examples/good/` or `examples/bad/`
- Tools: Add scripts to `tools/`

### 4. Test Changes
```bash
# Validate token counts are within targets
wc -w docs/quick-rules.md    # Should be ~800 tokens
wc -w docs/comprehensive-guide.md  # Should be ~2500 tokens

# Test any code examples
python -m py_compile examples/good/*.py
```

### 5. Commit with Proper Attribution

### Comprehensive Guide (`docs/comprehensive-guide.md`)
- **Target**: ~2500 tokens
- **Maximum**: 3000 tokens
- **Focus**: Detailed explanations and context
- **Format**: Full examples and thorough explanations

### Token Counting
```bash
# Count words (approximate token count)
wc -w docs/quick-rules.md
wc -w docs/comprehensive-guide.md

# More accurate token counting (if available)
tiktoken count docs/quick-rules.md
```
