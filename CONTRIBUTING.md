Add new exception handling patterns

This commit adds comprehensive examples of proper OpenStack
exception handling patterns, including specific exceptions,
logging practices, and error propagation techniques.

The initial examples were generated using Claude Code based on
existing OpenStack nova and neutron patterns. Manual modifications
included adding project-specific context, improving documentation,
and ensuring compliance with current hacking rules.

## üõ† Development Setup

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Python development
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install tox pre-commit

# Git configuration for DCO
git config user.name "Your Real Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

This repository uses pre-commit hooks for automated linting and formatting. Our modern linting stack includes:

- **ruff**: Fast Python linter and formatter (replaces autopep8 + hacking)
- **bandit**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **markdownlint**: Markdown style and formatting
- **Standard hooks**: Trailing whitespace, EOF fixes, YAML validation, etc.

#### Installation

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install the git hooks
pre-commit install

# (Optional) Run on all files to check current state
pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### What the hooks do

**Auto-fixing hooks** (will modify your files):

- Remove trailing whitespace
- Fix end-of-file newlines
- Enforce Unix line endings
- Remove tabs (spaces only)
- Format Python code with ruff (79 char line length)
- Fix auto-fixable linting issues

**Validation hooks** (will report errors):

- Python linting with ruff (OpenStack-compatible rules)
- Security scanning with bandit
- Markdown linting with markdownlint
- YAML/JSON syntax validation
- Apache license header check (Python files)
- DCO sign-off verification (REQUIRED)

#### Configuration files

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Hook configuration
- `ruff.toml`: Python linting/formatting rules (79 char line length, OpenStack-compatible)
- `.markdownlint.yaml`: Markdown linting rules
- `pyproject.toml`: Bandit security scanning configuration

For detailed information on pre-commit hooks and environment variables, see:

- `docs/environment-variables.md`: Complete reference for all environment variables and pre-commit customization

#### Bypassing hooks (NOT RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# Skip hooks for a single commit (use with caution)
git commit --no-verify
```

### Validation Tools

```bash
# Style checking
tox -e pep8

# Documentation linting
markdownlint docs/

# Token counting
python tools/count_tokens.py docs/quick-rules.md
```

## üõ† Development and Environment Setup

### CI/CD Pipeline

This repository uses Zuul CI/CD for automated testing and code review. For details on
job configuration, customization options, and environment variables, see:

- `docs/zuul-configuration.md`: Zuul job configuration guide and customization instructions
- `docs/environment-variables.md`: Environment variable reference for Zuul jobs

### Quick Start with Tox

This repository uses tox for development and linting:

```bash
# Run all linting checks
tox -e linters

# Create development environment (if needed)
tox -e linters --recreate
```

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate and install dependencies
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pre-commit ruff bandit

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run linting checks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The repository uses comprehensive pre-commit hooks:

- **ruff**: Modern Python linting and formatting (replaces autopep8 + hacking)
- **bandit**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **markdownlint**: Documentation quality checks
- **Custom hooks**: Apache license headers, DCO sign-off verification

### Environment Management

- Tox automatically manages virtual environments
- Use `tox -e linters --recreate` to recreate the environment if needed
- Dependencies are managed by tox and pre-commit for consistent linting

### Linting Workflow

1. Make your changes
2. Run `tox -e linters` to check all linting rules
3. Fix any reported issues (pre-commit will show diffs with --show-diff-on-failure)
4. Commit your changes (hooks will run automatically)
5. Fix any remaining issues and commit again
