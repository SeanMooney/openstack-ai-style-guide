Add resource cleanup to compute manager

The compute manager was not properly releasing resources when
instances were terminated, causing memory leaks in long-running
services. This was particularly visible in environments with
high instance turnover rates.

This commit adds explicit resource cleanup in the instance
deletion path, ensuring all event listeners and cached objects
are properly released. The implementation follows the pattern
used in the network manager but adds additional cleanup for
compute-specific resources.

I used Claude Code to generate the initial cleanup implementation
based on the existing network manager patterns. The AI generated
the basic resource tracking structure, cleanup methods, and
error handling framework. Manual modifications included:
- Integration with existing compute manager lifecycle hooks
- OpenStack-specific logging using oslo.log
- Custom error handling for partial cleanup failures
- Additional test cases for edge conditions
- Documentation updates for the resource management API

Testing: Added unit tests covering normal cleanup, partial
failures, and resource leak scenarios. Verified no regressions
in existing tempest tests.

## Example 2: Predictive AI (Minor Assistance)

Fix race condition in network port allocation

There was a race condition in the network port allocation code
where concurrent requests could allocate the same port twice,
leading to conflicts and failed instance launches. This occurred
when multiple compute nodes requested ports simultaneously from
the network service.

The fix adds proper locking around the port allocation check and
update operations. The implementation uses the existing lock
pattern from the IP address allocation code but adapted for
port allocation.

I used GitHub Copilot autocomplete suggestions for the lock
acquisition and error handling patterns. The core business logic,
lock scope determination, and integration with the existing port
allocation flow were written manually.

## Example 3: Feature Implementation with AI

```
Add support for multi-queue virtio network devices

Adds support for configuring multi-queue virtio network devices
to improve network throughput for instances with multiple vCPUs.
This feature allows each vCPU to have a dedicated queue for
network I/O, significantly improving performance for network-
intensive workloads.

The implementation adds a new flavor extra spec to control the
number of queues and updates the libvirt driver to configure
the virtio device accordingly. The queue count defaults to the
number of vCPUs but can be overridden via the flavor spec.

I used ChatGPT to generate the initial libvirt XML configuration
logic and virtio device setup code based on the libvirt
documentation. The AI provided the basic XML structure and
device configuration methods. Manual work included:
- Integration with Nova flavor system and validation
- Error handling for unsupported configurations
- Backwards compatibility with existing instances
- Complete test coverage including upgrade scenarios
- Full documentation including example flavor specs

Known limitations: Multi-queue support requires guest OS drivers
that support virtio-net multiqueue. This is available in Linux
3.8+ and recent Windows versions.

## Example 4: Bug Fix with Testing

```
Fix instance UUID collision in DB migration

Fixed a bug in the data migration script where instances could
receive duplicate UUIDs during the migration from legacy ID
format to UUID format. This occurred when the migration script
generated UUIDs without checking for collisions in the existing
UUID space.

The fix modifies the migration script to:
1. Check for UUID collisions before assignment
2. Regenerate UUIDs if a collision is detected
3. Log all UUID changes for audit purposes
4. Add validation after migration completes

I used GitHub Copilot to assist with the collision detection
logic and retry loop structure. The migration script logic,
database queries, validation checks, and rollback handling were
written manually. Added comprehensive tests covering collision
scenarios and migration validation.

## Example 5: Refactoring with AI

```
Refactor network port update to reduce complexity

The network port update method had grown to over 200 lines with
cyclomatic complexity of 25, making it difficult to maintain and
test. This refactoring breaks the monolithic method into smaller,
focused functions while preserving the existing behavior.

Changes include:
- Split port update into validation, update, and notification phases
- Extract common validation logic to reusable helpers
- Improve error messages with specific context
- Add intermediate logging for debugging
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing API

I used Claude Code to help identify refactoring opportunities
and generate the initial split of the large method. The AI
suggested the separation into validation, update, and notification
phases and generated skeleton code for each function. Manual work
included:
- Ensuring atomicity of database operations
- Preserving error handling behavior exactly
- Adding logging at appropriate points
- Writing tests for each extracted function
- Verifying no behavioral changes with existing tests

All existing tests pass without modification, confirming
behavior is preserved.

## Example 6: Documentation Update

```
Update API guide for flavor extra specs

Updated the API guide to include comprehensive documentation for
all flavor extra specs, including newly added specs from the last
three releases. The previous documentation was missing several
specs and had outdated information about deprecated specs.

Updates include:
- Complete table of all extra specs with descriptions
- Usage examples for complex specs
- Deprecation warnings for legacy specs
- Links to related blueprint documentation
- Migration guide from deprecated to current specs

I used ChatGPT to help format the extra specs table and generate
usage examples based on the code implementation. The AI created
the table structure and basic examples. Manual additions included:
- Accurate deprecation information from release notes
- Links to relevant blueprints and bugs
- Migration paths for deprecated features
- Review for technical accuracy
- Formatting for consistency with existing docs
