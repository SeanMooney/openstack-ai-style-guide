# Reusable task for checking OpenCode command results
#
# This task file consolidates the error handling pattern used across
# all OpenCode command executions (context extraction, commit analysis,
# and code review). It displays output on success, provides detailed
# diagnostics on failure, and validates that output files were created.
#
# Required variables:
#   - command_result: registered result from shell command
#   - command_name: human-readable name (e.g., "context extraction")
#   - agent_name: agent used (e.g., "zuul-context-extractor")
#   - output_file: expected output file path
#   - model_name: model used for this command

- name: "Display {{ command_name }} output on success"
  debug:
    var: command_result.stdout
  when: command_result.rc == 0

- name: "Check if {{ command_name }} command succeeded"
  fail:
    msg: |
      OpenCode {{ command_name }} command failed with return code {{ command_result.rc }}.

      STDOUT:
      {{ command_result.stdout | default('(empty)') }}

      STDERR:
      {{ command_result.stderr | default('(empty)') }}

      This likely indicates an issue with:
      - OpenCode installation or configuration
      - The {{ agent_name }} agent definition
      - LiteLLM proxy connectivity
      - Model availability ({{ model_name }})
  when: command_result.rc != 0

- name: "Verify {{ command_name }} output exists"
  stat:
    path: "{{ output_file }}"
  register: output_file_stat

- name: "Validate {{ command_name }} output"
  fail:
    msg: |
      {{ command_name | capitalize }} command succeeded but did not produce expected output file.
      Expected: {{ output_file }}

      This may indicate:
      - Agent did not complete successfully
      - Output was written to wrong location
      - File permission issues
  when: not output_file_stat.stat.exists

- name: "Display {{ command_name }} success"
  debug:
    msg: "âœ“ {{ command_name | capitalize }} completed successfully. Output at {{ output_file }}"
