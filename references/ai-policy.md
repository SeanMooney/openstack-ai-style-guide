# OpenInfra Foundation Policy for AI Generated Content

## Summary

Assistive AI tools are permitted, as long as contributions are marked with an "Assisted-By:" label in commit messages[1]. Generative AI tools, which produce complete code artifacts (not just small fragments or suggestions), are also permitted under limited circumstances[1]. Such tools are often used to provide a starting point, which is then reworked by the human author. If a substantial portion of a patch is generated in this way, it must be marked with a "Generated-By:" label[1].

The Foundation recommends using Open Source AI models trained on content with compatible licensing[1]. However, it also recognizes the AI tooling ecosystem and underlying models are evolving rapidly. This policy provides guardrails while encouraging transparency about tool usage, so contributors can benefit from AI productivity gains responsibly[1].

**Key Principles:**

- A human must always be in the loop[1]
- Contributors need to fully understand and be able to debug any AI-generated code they include[1]
- Treat AI-generated code as if it came from an untrusted source[1]
- Reviewers should apply heightened scrutiny to AI-generated content[1]
- Copyright law continues to apply to all preexisting works[1]

## Context

Technology rooted in artificial intelligence (AI) is an actively evolving area with exciting technical possibilities and significant legal uncertainties[2]. The OpenInfra Board of Directors wants to encourage exploration and adoption of new technologies while exercising reasonable caution around potential risks[2].

Currently there are three general broad buckets of technology use cases[2]:

**Predictive AI:**
- Often viewed as "suggestive auto-complete"[2]
- A contributor receives suggestive fragments which they can adopt and modify based upon the work they are executing[2]

**Generative AI:**
- The pattern of providing prose describing what you want, and the AI attempts to compose a result[2]
- May create a pattern where the prose is revised until a suitable result has been reached[2]

**Assistive AI:**
- Some generative tools can be used in assistive ways[2]
- For example, a prompt which might rename files or make other targeted changes which would have otherwise been performed by a human[2]

## Challenges

### Copyright Uncertainty

- Copyright law in this area is presently an evolving topic with a landscape which will take some time to stabilize[3]
- As of March 16th, 2023, Computer Generated work is not considered an original work which can be copyrighted in the United States with similar stances being taken in other countries around the world[3]

### Training Data and Licensing Concerns

- Source training data, and thus resulting material, may come from materials which have unclear or incompatible copyrights and/or licenses[3]
- Copyright of any generated code may be explicitly retained by the vendor operating the AI technology, which is incompatible with contribution to projects[3]
- Some tools have demonstrated the ability to source context from the contents of a project being worked upon[3]
- This requires awareness of the End-User License Agreement by the contributor[3]

### Evolving Technology

- This is an evolving area, and tools will evolve[3]
- What may be a Predictive tool today could be a partially Generative tool next week[3]
- Contributors need to be aware and take action based upon each particular situation[3]

## Applicability

This policy applies to all contributions of content committed into source revision control systems by projects housed under the OpenInfra Foundation[4].

## Policy and Guidance

### Foundation Policy

It is the policy of the OpenInfra Foundation that[5]:

- Contributions created using Predictive or Generative AI tools are generally permitted if contributors and reviewers follow the checklists below[5]
- Where possible, configure the AI tool to operate in modes that respect open source licensing (this will be different for each tool)[5]
- Any copyrighted materials authored or owned by third parties could be problematic, so make sure they are licensed as open source or public domain, or that you have permission from the copyright holder to release them as open source[5]
- Make sure the AI tool doesn't claim proprietary rights to the code or content generated by the tool[5]
- Contributions are generally expected to be made by a human taking an action, so the contributor has a chance to review their contribution for any technical or legal problems before submitting[5]
- The exception to the rule is that well-documented automated processes are allowed, such as release tooling or for internationalization updates[5]
- This policy will be re-evaluated and updated as the law, technology, and open source best practices continue to evolve[5]

### Contributor Checklist

As a contributor, you are responsible for the code you submit, whether you use AI tools or write it yourself[6]. Some AI tools offer settings, features, or modes that can help, but these are no substitute for your own review of code quality, correctness, style, security, and licensing[6].

**General Guidelines:**

- With all AI tools, contributors should be mindful of their limitations[6]
- Carefully review any suggested or generated code or comments to ensure nothing is inherently harmful, malicious, or outright incorrect[6]
- Generative AI tools should be operated in modes which are compatible with the Open Source Definition as maintained by the OSI[6]

**Tool Configuration:**

- When available, Generative AI features that flag output that resembles publicly available code and provide licensing information should be enabled[6]
- Such results should be used to prevent the contribution of incompatibly licensed open source code[6]
- When available, Generative AI features that are designed to block output suggestions that match publicly available code should be enabled[6]

**Commit Message Labels:**

- Add a **"Generated-By:"** label to the commit message for generative AI usage[6]
- Explain in comments or the commit message any prompts or background context the reviewers might need to fully understand the change and how much of the change was generated by the tool[6]
- If your tool assisted your changes (such as minor content edits based upon a prompt), use the **"Assisted-By:"** label instead of "Generated-By"[6]
- Add the "Assisted-By" label to your commit message and explain in comments or the commit message any context the reviewers might need to understand the change and how much of the change came from the tool[6]

**Contributor Responsibility:**

- By contributing you are indicating you have the permission and rights to submit the content to a project[6]
- Take care in checking that the output of the tool is compatible with the project's license[6]
- The "Signed-Off-By" label in your contribution is a statement that you take responsibility for the entire contents of the commit, including any parts that were generated or assisted by AI tools or other tools[6]
- This policy does not supersede any project specific requirements around actions to be taken prior to the submission of changes into review[6]

### Reviewer Checklist

**Verification Requirements:**

- When reviewing contributions with the "Generated-By" or "Assisted-By" labels, verify that the change includes sufficient explanation of the context that the reviewer and future contributors can understand the purpose and origin[7]
- Apply a higher level of scrutiny to contributions created using AI tools, understanding the limitations of the tools[7]
- This does not mean automatically rejecting all contributions that use AI tools, it means giving them the same consideration of technical and legal merits and standards as you would give to any other change[7]

**Code Quality:**

- Code style changes may be necessary to meet project standards and community guidelines, please work with the contributor as-needed[7]
- If the change set is substantially re-worked by human changes during the code review process, consider whether it makes sense to remove the "Generated-By" or "Assisted-By" label prior to committing[7]
